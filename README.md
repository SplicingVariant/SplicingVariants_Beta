# SplicingVariants_Beta
Maintained by Kaoru Ito (splicing.variant@gmail.com)

This document is for the paper "Identification of Pathigenic Gene Mutations in LMNA and MYBPC3 That Alter RNA splicing".
In the paper, we chose possibile splicing variants by in-silico prediction and tested them by cell-based splicing assay.
Several perl and R scripts placed here were employed to perform the analysis.

*** In the paper, we focused on splcing variants that create / lose splice site. If you'd like to know about exon-skipping variants, please check SPANR (http://tools.genes.toronto.edu/)***
